## Prerequisites

Before using the tool, ensure you have:

- **Python 3.7+** installed.
- Required Python libraries:
  - `pandas`
  - `asyncio`
  - `playwright`
  - `html2text`
  - `rich`
  - `json`
  - `re`
  - `smtplib`
  - `zipfile`
  - `fitz` (PyMuPDF)
- A valid GeminiLLM integration (or equivalent LLM API) available via the `LLMS.gemni_call` module.
- A configured `config.py` file with your SMTP credentials, job title, locations, and the number of jobs to scrape.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd job-search-automation
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**  
   It is recommended to create a virtual environment first.
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   *Ensure that `requirements.txt` lists all the necessary libraries mentioned above.*

3. **Set Up Configuration**  
   Create a `config.py` file in the project root with your specific settings. For example:
   ```python
   USERNAME = "your_email@gmail.com"
   PASSWORD = "your_email_password"
   JOB_TITLE = "Cloud Technical Lead"
   LOCATIONS = ["Europe", "USA", "Asia"]
   NUM_JOBS = 20
   ```

## Usage

1. **Prepare Your Resume**
   - Place your PDF resume in the `CV` directory.
   - On the first run, the tool will convert your PDF resume into a Markdown file and optimize it for ATS compliance. If the Markdown version already exists, the conversion will be skipped.

2. **Run the Automation Script**
   Execute the main script:
   ```bash
   python your_script.py
   ```
   The script will:
   - Convert your PDF resume to an ATS-compliant Markdown format.
   - Scrape LinkedIn for job listings based on your job title and specified locations.
   - Extract detailed job information and analyze it against your resume.
   - Save all results in CSV files under the `CSVS` directory.
   - Zip the CSV files and send them via email using your SMTP settings.

## Components

- **ResumeConverter**  
  Converts a PDF resume to Markdown and then to an ATS-compliant resume using GeminiLLM.

- **LinkedInJobScraper**  
  Scrapes job listings from LinkedIn and displays them in a formatted table using the Rich library.

- **JobMatcher**  
  Matches the ATS-compliant resume against job descriptions, outputting a JSON with match scores, statistics, and recommendations.

- **LinkedInJobPageScraper & LinkedInCrawler**  
  Extract detailed job descriptions and criteria asynchronously from individual job pages and compile the data.

- **Utility Functions**  
  - `zip_csv_files()`: Zips all CSV files in the `CSVS` folder.
  - `send_email()`: Sends the ZIP archive via email using your SMTP credentials.

## Customization

- **LLM Prompts**  
  Modify the conversion and job matching prompts in the code to better suit your needs.
  
- **Scraping Parameters**  
  Adjust the job title, location, and number of jobs in `config.py` or directly in the code to customize your search.
  
- **Output Formats**  
  Extend the functionality to support additional output formats or integrate with other systems as needed.

## Troubleshooting

- **Playwright Issues**  
  Ensure Playwright is installed and that the required browsers are set up:
  ```bash
  playwright install
  ```

- **LLM API Errors**  
  Verify that your GeminiLLM integration is active and that any required API keys or credentials are correctly configured.

- **Email Sending Problems**  
  Double-check the SMTP credentials in `config.py` and ensure your email provider supports SMTP access.
